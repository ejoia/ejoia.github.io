    This is where I will be showing you all of my java programing, scripts, and  <br>
    programs.  As a programming beginner, I thought Java was what was used to    <br>
    integrate the different explorers as a client side application to take input <br>
    as it was applying it to the hardware for an output.  I guess I was right and<br>
    wrong.  Regraless, I will apply it here but, most importantly, will learn it.<br>
