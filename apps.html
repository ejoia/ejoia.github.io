      <h1>APPlaud my applicability of Computer Programming!</h1>
      <p>
        Here I will be proving an audience with a cavas to view and test my apps, in <br>
        realtime.  All of these projects were created as part of the curriculum in   <br>
        'The Joy of Programming.'  As of now, the content featured is concurrent with<br>
        the classwork and progression, according to the syllabus.  Bare with me, as I<br>
        have no control over the punctuality of updated content, as this is a class. <br>
        Stay tuned, though for new content will be posted in the near future.<br>
        apps, multimedia, computer games, graphics, and animation.
